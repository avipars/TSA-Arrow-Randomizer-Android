TSA paid IBM $47,000 to build a random arrow line generator (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/04/tsa-spent-47000-on-an-app-that-just-randomly-picks-lanes-for-passengers/). I am trying out github and wanted to push a simple project for my first time. Thanks to Chris Pacia (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEpqmPL3bgw) for the code tutorial. I made some minor changes and plan on improving the app in other places as well, you are welcome to help me!
