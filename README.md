# TSArandom
TSA paid IBM $1.4 Million Dollars to build a random arrow line generator. I am trying out github and wanted to push a simple project for my first time. Thanks to Chris Pacia (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GEpqmPL3bgw) for the code tutorial. I made some minor changes and plan on improving the app in other places as well, you are welcome to help me!
